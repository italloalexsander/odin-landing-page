# odin-landing-page

#### Project made for the Odin Project course. In this assignment i had to make a website using pretty much just HTML5 and CSS that looked as much as possible as this one:

![Model i should base mine on](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png)

#### The Result can be seen below:

#### It should be noted that responsiveness was especifically not a part of the assignment, so i ignored that. Custom images and different text is also there, just to give a more unique face.
